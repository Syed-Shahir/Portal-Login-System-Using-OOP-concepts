# Portal-Login-System-Using-OOP-concepts
These programs demonstrate the employee Portal system where first data is stored and later on sign in and sign out timings are noted aswell the number of employee can be changed
These two programs are design to act as a Log in Portal for employees,where name and there id numbers are saved then employee type is selected , saving information is based on users input if the user wants to save data or not ,There is sign in and sign out time check available aswell , The program is design for limited number of employees but it can be edited further for own requirements
one program is simple and other program is modified and other people have contributed to it aswell 
first simple should be analysed and understand later on the modified should be checked out
